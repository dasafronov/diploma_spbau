## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/dasafronov/diploma_spbau.git


Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the project directory and run the Python code.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

You can install these dependencies using pip. For example:

pip install numpy


## Compiling the Code

If you want to compile the Python code, you can use auto-py-to-exe. This is a simple GUI tool that allows you to convert a Python script into a standalone executable file.

You can install auto-py-to-exe using pip:

pip install auto-py-to-exe


Once you have installed auto-py-to-exe, you can run it from the command line:

auto-py-to-exe


This will open the auto-py-to-exe GUI. From here, you can select your Python script and configure the settings for the executable file. Once you have configured the settings, you can click the "Convert .py to .exe" button to compile the code.
